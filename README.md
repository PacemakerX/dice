# dice

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A simple Flutter “Dice” app built as part of my journey to learn Flutter and cross-platform development. This project evolves as I explore widgets, state management, animations, and app architecture. Each commit reflects a new concept learned or a feature added.

A few resources to get you started with your Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
